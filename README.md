## Practice Exercises

1. [extra-long-factorials](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/extra-long-factorials/problem)
    * Golang solution.
    * Includes function (`requestFactorialShort()`) using `MulRange()` from `maths.big` that handles the calculation and conversion and greatly simplifies the resulting code: [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19308076).
    * `go run extra-long-factorials.go` by default prints factorial of 25 for both implementations.
    * Test cases included covering inside and outside the accepted bounds of `1 <= n <= 100`.
